This project is about finding the quantity of each stock an investor should hold in his portfolio given that
he is interested in risky securities. We select data on prices of securities of eight companies over the last one
year and performed the classical statistical analysis including mean, variance, covariance and correlation to
measure expected returns and risk involved in securities.
